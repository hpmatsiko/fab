        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        Emmaus Bible School in Rwanda is a branch of the Emmaus Correspondence School Ministries, an international Bible correspondence school, non-denominational in outreach whose purpose is to encourage people to the systematic study of the word of God. 
        It gets its name from the Bible, in Luke 24:13-35, where two of Jesus’ disciples were walking along the road from Jerusalem to Emmaus discussing all that happened after the Lord’s death on the Cross. The Lord joined them in their walk and expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself (Luke 24.27), and opened to them the scriptures (Luke 24.32).
        The Emmaus Bible School worldwide is committed to help people from every nation who would seek to know more of God’s word to “open” the scriptures by providing biblical sound resources and structured bible courses so that they may accept Christ as their Saviour and Lord, grow in Christ, and share their faith with others.
        From its small beginnings in 1940s in Toronto (Canada), the Emmaus Bible correspondence school has grown and become the largest bible based correspondence school in the world.  Today, over 1 million courses are distributed annually in more than 100 countries around the world, and in over 125 languages.  A number of missionaries and churches have made Emmaus courses a vital part of their evangelistic and bible teaching ministries.<br>
     <h3>Historical background of Emmaus Bible School in Rwanda</h3>
       

    </div>
</div>
<div>   
        In 1935, a Canadian Brethren missionary Robert Edward Harlow and his wife, Margaret, set sail from Toronto, their home town, to Belgium Congo and spent some time there as missionaries. Upon returning to Canada Harlow saw a real need for a school in North American where principles of New Testament Christianity can be taught without compromise. </div>
<div style="display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;">
<div style="width: 110vh;">
    Then after, Harlow left his Congo mission station and in collaboration with his two friends, John Smart and C. Ernest Tatham, began the organizing of Emmaus Bible School which opened evening classes in 1941. Aware that people wanted to study God’s Word, but not everyone could attend the evening classes, and in order to accommodate those individuals from outside of Toronto area, the Emmaus Bible School decided to send lessons to them in the form of correspondence courses since 1942.
    The correspondence courses were soon widely in use all over the North America in Sunday Schools, Camps, and youth groups. Missionaries all over the world as well as nationals started using Emmaus courses in their evangelical and biblical ministries. It is with this historical background that the Emmaus Bible School was brought in Rwanda by Brethren missionaries.
    ⦁   Historical overview of the Emmaus Bible School in Rwanda
    Emmaus Bible School (EBS) was introduced in Rwanda in 1962 by John E Lacey (Jack), an American brethren missionary, as one of key pillars of his evangelism ministry in Rwanda with the purpose to introduce people to a personal knowledge and relationship with Jesus Christ as their saviour and Lord.

<div style="width: 50vh;">
    The first important development of EBE in Rwanda happens in 1979 when Mr. Robert Cullen became a missionary at Inkuru Nziza and took the rein of Emmaus ministry in Rwanda. Cullen put a great deal of effort into Emmaus ministry during his time.  Together with Miss Margaret and native volunteers, he made available a number of courses in Kinyarwanda. However, the leadership crises that occurred in the 1980s forced Cullen to move to UGANDA (in 1988) where he started a fruitful chapter of Emmaus School at Kabare

<div style="width: 50vh;">
    The second important development comes from Mr. Peter Andrews, a missionary to Inkuru Nziza since 1990. As other previous missionary, Peter put the coordination of EBE as his first priority. During his time, The EBE was able to build an office, have full time staffs to run the school’s daily work. As results, the number of Emmaus courses translated in Kinyarwanda increased, more students were enrolled, and the prison ministry was strengthened. Moreover, Andrews revived the radio ministry where the EBE produces 2 hours of broadcasts a week in Kinyarwanda

<div style="width: 45vh;">
    In 2003, Samuel Muhire who had worked for a long-time assisting Andrews in EBE ministry was appointed as the National coordinator of Emmaus Correspondence School in Rwanda. Working hand and hand with Andrews, he put emphasis on the creation of several Emmaus Correspondence School centres and sub-centres in different parts of the country to easy the distribution of Emmaus courses.

<div style="width: 140vh;">
    Today, the Emmaus Bible School operates in 4 regions where 15 centres have been established to better follow up it ministries. It has 3 full-time staff and 18 volunteers responsible of Emmaus Bible School in their centres and sub-centres. The Emmaus Bible School in Rwanda works under the main ministries which include Emmaus correspondence school, Radio ministry and prison ministry.
    Without a doubt, for the above 60 years of EBS operations working in Rwanda, it has helped thousands of people from different denominations, schools, hospitals, and prisons to walk with the Lord, enlightened with Him, and learn directly from Him through the truths of his word (the Bible) using the lessons they received by correspondence.

    <h2>EMMAUS CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL</h2>
    As we have seen above, the Emmaus ministry was brought by John E Lacey (Jack) in 1962 as a ministry of Inkuru Nziza Association. Jack Lacey (+2002) and Nyamukama Michel (+2008) had been using Emmaus courses in connection with Radio ministry since 1958 while they ministered in Bujumbura/Burundi. In 1961 they moved to Kigali (Rwanda) and built a Centre of Christian Information (known as Foyer Inkuru Nziza) where they distributed books/Courses written in English, French and Kiswahili to a few numbers of people in the city of Kigali.
    It is not well known when the first lessons in Kinyarwanda started and who the first students were, however it is known that since 1965, some courses, such as “what the Bible Teaches” and “the servant of God” were translated in Kinyarwanda as well as a number of tracts. 
    

</div>
</div>
<div>In 1970, when Jack Lacey returned to his home country, the ministry of Emmaus, especially the Kinyarwanda courses, went slowly until two missionaries, miss. Margaret Petrie (1977) and Robert Cullen (1979) come in Rwanda and dedicated themselves to the ministry. Together with local volunteers, they made available 8 Emmaus courses in Kinyarwanda. In 1982, the number of Emmaus students grown up to 80 students who took a EBE course, with 48 courses available in three languages: Kinyarwanda (8), Swahiri (4), French (12) and English 24. In 1988, Robert Cullen moved to Kabare (Uganda) where he started a fruitful Emmaus ministry.
    In 1990, Mr Peter Andrews became a missionary at Inkuru Nziza church. He put a big effort in Emmaus ministry.  During his time, more than 2000 students were enrolled in EBE, with 24 courses translated in Kinyarwanda and 3 staffs were at EBE office in Kigali. While Peter Andrews continued to serve Emmaus Correspondence School as a full-time missionary, in 1998 he returned to his home country (UK) and then continued to serve but as a visiting missionary. 
    In 2003, Mr Sam Muhire took over the coordination of Emmaus ministry. In addition to existing Emmaus activities, he revived the key ministries of Emmaus ministry in the first two decencies of their ministry in Rwanda: Radio ministry and Prison ministry. 
    In 2019, 7,474 students (including 170 in prisons) were enrolled in EBE, 44 courses translated into Kinyarwanda, 15 EBE Centres were operational organized in four regions (Kigali Region, Southern Region, Western Region, northern Region and Eastern Region).</div>
<div>
    Today Emmaus Bible School in Rwanda has 49 courses translated in Kinyarwanda. With every course completed successfully a student receives a report card with the name of course completed, the percentage earned and the date. Upon accomplishment of the 12 courses, the student receives a certificate and when a further 12 are completed, the students receive a diploma. Over the last three years (2020-2022), there were 46,762 courses sent out to all corners of the country with 38,337 being returned for making. A number of our students has a good commitment in that 1,179 earned their certificates having completed the first twelve courses while 1,027 received diplomas (having completed 24 courses).

        RADIO MINISTRY
        Radio evangelism is one of the ministries that has contributed in building early Christianity in Rwanda in the1960ies-1970ies. The pioneers of Emmaus Correspondence School (ECS) in Rwanda began with radio and distribution of literature/Christian tracts ministries as an entry point of evangelizing. Emmaus was the first radio ministry for the whole country, 1,5 hours in in Kinyarwanda (local language) and 1,5 hours in French every week. Like other Brethren ministries in the country, ECS was also jeopardized by the departure of missionary Jack Lacey. ECS Radio ministry succumbed pressure especially from the Protestant Council and, by 1979 Brethren opportunity to evangelize through radio was taken away and given to Protestant Council. 

    </div>

</div>

<div>
    In 2005, Emmaus Bible School has had the privilege of being again able to teach the Scripture and evangelize through Umucyo Community Radio Station, a Christian radio broadcasting from Kigali. It began with a 60-minute slot in Kinyarwanda, three time a week and later twice a week. Many have come to know the Lord through our Radio broadcasts and many more enrolled the Emmaus Bible School through the same Radio program. However, even though we praise God for the reviving of ECS Radio ministry, we are far behind where was the same ministry in the 1960-1970ies whereby we used to have our own studio and materials to prepare radio broadcasts and full-time staff for ECS radio program. It is our prayer that our Lord and God of harvest will continue to support and sustain Evangelism through Correspondence School.

    <h3>EMMAUS PRISON MINISTRY</h3>
    The same as radio program, prison ministry is one of ministries with which Brethen Mission started with in Rwanda in the 1962. In the first two decades of brethren ministry in Rwanda, Inkurunziza was coordinating all of Protestant evangelism programs especially in Kigali City, including radio and prison programs. Archives indicates that Inkurunziza (Brethren) Church was the one and only church with authirzation to evangelize in Rwandan prisons in the 1960-1970ies. For example, in her field report of 1964-1967, 1977-1986; Miss Margaret Petrie, a Canadian missionary of Inkurunziza/Brethen Chruch wrote “We had the joy of baptizing two prisoners from the local jail. They are among those who have been studying the Emmaus courses. Special permission was given for them to come to a river just outside of town [probably at Nyabugogo], accompanied by a guard.”

</div>
<div>
    In 1970, the Emmaus Prison Ministry had to be closed due to the departure of Jack Lacey and Margaret Petrie the main initiators and supporters of the ministry. However, after the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, the prison ministry was reactivated. The Rwanda EBE has been accepted by the Rwanda Correctional Service (RCS) as providing a suitable teaching to prisoners. Through the co-operation of the Rwanda Prison Fellowship, Emmaus Bible School courses are being studied and completed by more than 800 students in over 7 correctional centres in Rwanda (Prison). Emmaus staff and some Brethren pastors are allowed to visit the prisons to preach the gospel and introduce the EBE courses. Over the last five years (2018-2022), there were 16,622 courses sent out to all the 7 correctional centres of the country. 674 earned their certificates having completed the first twelve courses while 423 received diplomas (having completed 24 courses), moreover, more than 1800 people shown their commitment to Jesus by being baptised.

    The Emmaus Prison Ministry is very encouraging. It gives us cause for much thanksgiving to God as we learn of the many students who find the courses a real help in leading them to a knowledge of God and into further service for the Lord. However the need for Bible in the prisons is always there, as well as logistics for the ministry.

    <h3>⦁   Envisioning the Future – The EBE Strategic Plan 2024-2029 </h3>
    Since its beginning in 1962, the EBS has been working under the shadow of Inkurunziza Church and because of that, it does not have its own legal document authorizing its operations in the country. Over time, the lack of legal authorization documents has created confusion in the administration and management of EBS, especially in their relationship with Inkurunziza (as the administrative host), and with other denominations and faith-based organizations. These challenges have reached their pick in 2021 when the Inkurunziza Leadership decided to relocate its national administrative offices including the EBS office due to renovation constructions that were planned to last for three years’ time.
    It is in that perspective that the EBS leadership has realized that it is high time to put in place a strategy plan to respond to all these challenges. The following are the highlights of the key pillars and objectives that will be included in the strategic plan.

    <h3>⦁   Envisioning the Future – The EBE Strategic Plan 2024-2029 </h3>
    Since its beginning in 1962, the EBS has been working under the shadow of Inkurunziza Church and because of that, it does not have its own legal document authorizing its operations in the country. Over time, the lack of legal authorization documents has created confusion in the administration and management of EBS, especially in their relationship with Inkurunziza (as the administrative host), and with other denominations and faith-based organizations.

    It is in that perspective that the EBS leadership has realized that it is high time to put in place a strategy plan to respond to all these challenges. The following are the highlights of the key pillars and objectives that will be included in the strategic plan.

    <h3>1.  EBE MINISTRY DEVELOPMENT </h3>
    ⦁   Create and strengthen existing EBE Centres and Sub-Centres to teach and disseminate the word of God through distance education in the form of Bible courses and other material.
    ⦁   Develop the EBE online course – using Kinyarwanda language (the online application is available in English, French, and Kiswahili)
    ⦁   Strengthen Radio ministry – to make it a unique strategy for evangelization, teaching the Word of God and sensitization for new students’ enrolment. 
    ⦁   Prison ministry – empowering (including regular retreats and refresher training) for all the volunteers serving in prison ministry and set a strong and sustainable mechanism of our the EBE ministry in Prison.
    <h3>2.  EBE LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT</h3>
    ⦁   Ministry Leaders empowerment – Recruitment, Equipment, Motivation, and Retention of Ministry leaders
    ⦁   Improving Ministry Delivery – Develop (and print out for use) of the EBE Ministry Manual in Kinyarwanda to organize the functioning and management of centres and sub-centres across the country.
    ⦁   Promote EBE Volunteering – Set in place strong and sustainable strategies to create passion for volunteering in EBE ministry (through EBE promotion week, materials, radio talk, etc.)
    ⦁   Empowerment of Staff and Volunteers – Set in place regular refresher training and ministry retreat for EBE leaders and volunteers (at least one retreat per year for ministry leaders, and one refresher training per year for ministry volunteers)

    <h3>3.EBE RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURES DEVELOPMENT </h3>
    ⦁   Construction of EBE Head Office and Print House – the current office premises are no longer accepted by the Government urban settings laws. 
    ⦁   Office Equipment – as we are envisaging to move into new buildings, we also plan to equip the EBE Head office, Print House, Centres, and Sub-centres with the minimum required materials for effective functioning.

</div>
</div>

<div>
    Transport facilitation – to sustain the achievements we need to at least have one vehicle to facilitate national coordination and empowerment of centres and sub-centres. 
    ⦁   Secure Salary for (at least) Ministry Core Staff – as of now, all our staff (including the Country Director) are working on a semi or completely voluntary basis which, compared to the current cost of living, seems unfair for the ministry development.

</div>

<div>

    <h3>⦁   CALL FOR SUPPORT</h3>
    Considering the above objectives, we would like to achieve, we therefore invite all the people of goodwill to partner with us in this enormous ministry. Not only we need financial support, but also, we need encouragement, advice and expertise to help us meet the challenges that lay before us. Volunteers from around the world are needed to assist us in so many areas, such as development of our website, networking with Emmaus correspondence schools, applying for grants, and developing our promotional material. We strongly invite anyone who is interested to spend some time with us in Rwanda and experience first-hand the reward of volunteering with EBE Rwanda through its different ministries. 
    <h3>⦁   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
    The EBE Rwanda would like to express its gratitude to its partners and particularly acknowledge the support it has received from: 
    ⦁   Inkuru Nziza Church of Rwanda
    ⦁   Peter Andrews and others EBE Rwanda supporters in UK
    ⦁   Helmut Schultz and EBE ZAM 
    ⦁   ECS worldwide
    ⦁   Prison Fellowship Rwanda
    ⦁   Umucyo Community Radio station, broadcasting from Kigali.
